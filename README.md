# Housing-Project-Data Cleaning using SQL
Data cleaning is the most important step in Data Anlaytics. Data is like the heart, the cleaner you keep the data the better the dataset will function and that is what I have explored here- different ways to clean the data using SQL queries on MS SQL Server.
The dataset that has been taken here is the Nashville Housing data and it is available in this repository as well.
The SQL queries used for the data cleaning steps, with detailed explanations, have also been added in this repository.
Thank You!
